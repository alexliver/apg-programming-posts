<h1>TL;DR</h1>
<p>
  When trying to fix a bug in your code, never do the following things: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Modify code in a trial-and-error way, at a very early stage
  </li>
  <li>
    Assume that there is only one error leads to the bug
  </li>
  <li>
    Fix code before you are absolute certain that the line of code causes error
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  but instead, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Inspect the code
  </li>
  <li>
    Construct failing unit tests
  </li>
  <li>
    Use a debugger (or insert log statements)
  </li>
  <li>
    Construct a minimum working example to reproduce the bug 
  </li>
  <li>
    Unless absolutely necessary, tweak the code and pray that it would work
  </li>
</ol>
<h1>The disciplines of bug fixing: premature bug-fixing considered harmful</h1>
<p>
  Fixing a bug in a computer program is hard. This is particularly true for new programmers and for
  unfamiliar code bases. Common programming tasks such as testing and debugging can be as 
  challenging as code writing itself, but they usually are not as recognized in academia and 
  corporate environments, which inspires me to write this article.
</p>
<p>
  Not only are bug fixes hard, they can also be liabilities in the software development process.
  I have seen numerous cases in production software 
  where bug fix fails. When a bug fix fail, a new bug may occur, or will cause hazard in future 
  development (technical debt).
</p>
<p>
  To ensure the quality of bug fixes and make the bug fix process more efficient, we need to apply 
  disciplines to prevent programmers to fix a bug prematurely.
</p>
<h2>What is premature bug-fixing</h2>
<p>
  Premature bug-fixing is a result in a programmer's laziness. It happens in a scenario like this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A bug occurs
  </li>
  <li>
    The programmer thinks a line of code may cause the bug
  </li>
  <li>
    The programmer changes the line of code
  </li>
  <li>
    The bug is fixed
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  or
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A bug occurs
  </li>
  <li>
    The programmer runs debug mode and observes anomalies in local variables
  </li>
  <li>
    The programmer thinks a line of code may cause the local variables to go wrong
  </li>
  <li>
    The programmer changes the line of code
  </li>
  <li>
    The bug is fixed
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  or worse
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A bug occurs
  </li>
  <li>
    The programmer thinks a variable's value has correlation to the bug
  </li>
  <li>
    The programmer tweaks the value until the bug disappears
  </li>
  <li>
    The bug is fixed
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In the above scenarios, the programmer do not have sufficient knowledge about the actual cause of
  the bug. Before attempting to fix a bug, the programmer should ask him/herself: am I 100% certain 
  that this line of code is erroneous? If this question cannot be answered, the programmer risks the 
  danger of premature bug-fixing.
</p>
<h2>Why trial-and-error debugging is evil</h2>
<p>
  Trial-and-error debugging is an extreme case of premature bug-fixing, and is wasteful and 
  extremely dangerous. If a programmer uses trial-and-error debugging, it means the programmer lacks 
  of the knowledge of the cause of the bug and even the code logic itself. And if there are two 
  parts of code contribute to the bug, tweak one part of the code using trial-and-error can rarely 
  solve the issue, so it can take longer to fix the bug than finding the bug at the first place.
</p>
<h2>Employ the mentality of a detective</h2>
<p>
  Bug fixing is like investigating a crime scene. When watching the TV series <i>Elementary</i>
  with my wife, I realized many parallels can be drawn between the process of identifying the 
  criminal, and finding a bug in codes. The similarities are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A detective needs to gather enough evidence before accusing the suspect.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  When debugging a programming you don't want to "fix" a code that is perfectly correct and/or miss
  the actually problematic code.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    A good detective is observant to evidences.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Gathering information is crucial in the debugging process. A number of tools can help this: 
  debugger, logging, memory verifier, profiler, and so on.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Deductive logic reasoning is used extensively in a criminal investigation.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Logic reasoning is a common activity in debugging. Common types of logic reasoning are:
</p>
<h3>Deductive reasoning</h3>
<p>
  <b>Example:</b>
  The value of variable var_a is wrong. The value of var_a is populated by function func_a, and is
  never tempered with since. Therefore, the logic of func_a is erroneous.
</p>
<p>
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning'>Deductive reasoning</a>
  is to reach conclusion with certainty from observations. Gathering evidence 
  and making logical deductions should be the concentration of the debugging process. If a bug is 
  traced and fixed purely through deductive reasoning, we can be certain that the bug is fixed 
  successfully.
</p>
<h3>Inductive reasoning</h3>
<p>
  <b>Example:</b>
  There is a out-of-memory error in the program. After a web search, the program find out that 
  others fixed their out-of-memory error by calling the garbage collection manually. Therefore, the
  programmer adds code to trigger manual garbage collection as a bug fix.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Another example:</b>
  There is a bug in the program. There was a bug-fix for a similar issue yesterday in a different 
  part of the system. Therefore, the programmer applies the same bug-fix to the program.
</p>
<p>
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning'>Inductive reasoning</a>
  reaches conclusions from the implications of evidences. The conclusions drawn from inductive 
  reasoning is not necessarily the truth, so use it to construct 
  <a href="#header_hypothesis">hypotheses</a>, or use is as bug fix
  after deductive reasoning has failed and the error is 
  <a href='#header_mwe'>isolated</a>.
</p>
<h3>Abductive reasoning</h3>
<p>
  <b>Example:</b>
  There is a bug in the program. The program works fine yesterday. Alex pushed a change set this 
  morning. Therefore, the bug is within Alex's change set.
</p>
<p>
  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning#Abductive_reasoning_.28abduction.29'>
    Abductive reasoning
  </a>
  is a process of finding the easiest explanation for an observation. Abductive reasoning is not 
  suitable for reaching a conclusion for bug fix in computer programs because it is likely to be 
  wrong due to the complexity of the code base. In this example, the Alex's code can be correct, but 
  it triggers some problematic code elsewhere in the code base. It is, though, a way to construct 
  <a href="#header_hypothesis">hypotheses</a> which helps the debugging process.
</p>
<h1>The methods of bug fixing</h1>
<h2>
  Inspection - Inspect the code
</h2>
<p>
  If you are fixing someone else's code, code inspection is firstly about understanding the logic 
  of the code. Note that there is no need to understand the entire code base to apply a bug fix. 
  Theoretically, you only need to grasp the codes that lead to the bug. To help understanding 
  complexed code, you can make use of debugger to follow the actual flow.
</p>
<p>
  With the knowledge of the code, you can start guessing where the error is. In some cases the most
  trivial bug can be found, like a typo. If you are <b>absolutely certain</b> that you have found 
  the bug, fix it and call it a day. Otherwise, you need to dig deeper using a debugger or other 
  tools.
</p>
<h2> Test automation - Construct failing unit tests </h2>
<p>
  Intergrating test-driven development (TDD) is a great way to start the bug fixing process. By
  writing a unit test, you have basically avoided the same bug recurring in the future. And by
  writing the test beforehand, it saves the hassle to test the solution manually. It is however
  dangerous to shift the mentality from "fixing the bug" to "try to make the unit test pass". You
  still need to make sure that you find the actual cause of the bug in the following steps.
</p>
<h2 id='header_hypothesis'>
  Hypothesis - Make guesses about the bug
</h2>
<p>
  Making hypotheses is a continuous activity throughout the debugging process. After a hypothesis is
  made, other debugging methods can follow to verify the hypothesis, and after other debugging
  methods are done, new hypotheses can be made. Debugging is an recursive process, which finishes
  when the bug is found. If a dead end is met, try using a different direction or approach. 
  Examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Hypothesis - the value of var_a is invalid.
  </li>
  <li>
    Verifies the hypotheses by using a debugger.
  </li>
  <li>
    New hypothesis: the invalid value of var_a is populated by the function func_a.
  </li>
  <li>
    Verifies the hypotheses by re-running the debugger. This time step into func_a.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Hypothesis - there is a bug in the third party library lib_a.
  </li>
  <li>
    A web search further strengthens the hypothesis, but not necessarily proves it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Verifies the hypothesis by constructing a minimum working example to isolate the usage of lib_a
    from the rest of the system.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Probing - Use a debugger (or insert log statements)
</h2>
<p>
  The debugger is the most powerful tool in a programmer's arsenal. It is like giving a detective
  the ability to travel in time to relive the crime. However, unlike time, the programming logic is
  non-linear and tricky. Therefore, the programmer are given the ability to dissect the code by
  inserting breakpoints.
</p>
<p>
  If there is a hypothesis in place, the programmer can insert the breakpoint where it expose the
  maximum amount of information in order to prove the hypothesis. If there is no hypothesis yet, add
  a breakpoint where you think is before the actual bug. Step over the code and observe important
  variables, until a hypothesis can be made.
</p>
<p>
  In some cases the debugger may not work (the debugger doesn't work for the language, or the bug
  doesn't occur when running the debugger). Writing logs can be an alternative to running a
  debugger. It has the ability to prove hypotheses and gather evidence by writing specific variables
  to the console or file system, but it cannot not expose as much information as a debugger can. And
  besides, writing logs is not always reliable. In many systems log writing uses buffered IO, which
  may fail when the program crashes. 
</p>
<h2 id='header_mwe'>
  Isolation - Construct a minimum working example to reproduce the bug 
</h2>
<p>
  Some hypotheses cannot be proven through the usage of a debugger or logger. This can happen when
  you suspect there is a bug within a third-party program, or the problem is impossible to be
  traced. A common scenario is UI layout issues across different platforms. If such things happen,
  it's time to construct a minimum working example (MWE) which reproduces the bug to isolate the
  suspected problem from the rest of the code.
</p>
<p>
  Constructing an MWE does not fix the bug directly, but it shows that a part of the code is
  problematic. After MWE is constructed, it may be apparent that a third-party library is to blame
  for the bug, and it is much easier for the programmer to seek help from other people using the MWE
  instead of the whole system. Besides, a lot of the problem with the program or the debug process
  may be discovered when constructing an MWE.
</p>
<h2>
  Unless absolutely necessary, tweak the code and pray that it would work
</h2>
<p>
  This is clutching at straws to rescue the program from the bug. 
  
  Several questions need to be answered before using the trial-and-error approach:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Have I examined all possible evidences along the execution path?
  </li>
  <li>
    Have I created MWE to demonstrate the bug that I'm dealing with?
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you can answer these questions with 'yes', then you can process with trial-and-error.
  The tweaking should only be done on the MWE, but not the actual code itself.
</p>
<h2>
  Other tools
</h2>
<p>
  Use a profiler for performance related issues. Use a memory verifier (such as Valgrind) for memory
  problems in non-memory-safe languages.
